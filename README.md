# Class Seat Change System

This is a front-end project that can be used for changing students' seats in a classroom. Simply open the HTML file to use this seat change system.

It has the following features:
* 1. Dynamic seat arrangement: You can fill in the form according to the actual situation of the class seats and dynamically assign students' seat positions.
* 2. Excel information entry: You can copy and paste students' names into the form of the seat change system; the form will ask you to fill in the number of female students (e.g., 20), and after filling in, the first 20 students will be defaulted as female students.
* 3. Random seat change: Supports random assignment of students' positions.
* 4. Separate seating for males and females: It can make boys sit with boys and girls sit with girls, that is, boys and girls sit separately.
* 5. Voluntary seat change: If the randomly assigned position is not as expected, you can click on two students' seat boxes to swap their seats.

Welcome to use my front-end webpage, and you are also welcome to take it as a project to learn. However, this project was made when I was a sophomore in high school. The code specifications are not up to standard, and there are some bugs. If you find them, please feel free to point them out, and we can learn together.

欢迎大家来使用我的前端网页，也欢迎大家把它当作一个项目来学习。但这个项目是我高二的时候做的，  
代码的规范等都是不达标的，也存在一些bug，如果大家发现了它们，欢迎大家提出来，我们一起学习。
